	Hi! <br><br>

	You need to be an enrolled undergraduate as of September 16th to participate in HackMIT. We can whitelist your email if you send us some proof of admission and enrollment. This is usually a picture of your student ID. <br><br>

	If your college provides you with an educational email, we can whitelist the entire domain so that you and your classmates can register for HackMIT. <br><br>

	Thank you for your interest!<br><br>

	Best <br>
	Hackbot <br>

	Hi! <br><br>

	We've whitelisted the email address {email}. You can now use this for registration! <br><br>

	Hi! <br><br>

	Thanks for reaching out! We get this question a lot, and it's quite common for teams to be mixed MIT/non-MIT. <br><br>

	The MIT students will be guaranteed a spot at HackMIT, while the rest of the team will be admitted as a unit via our admission process (although not guaranteed admission). There's nothing special other than having each person join the same team in our registration system! <br><br>

	Hope that helps,<br>

	Hi, <br><br>

	Thanks for reaching out! Unfortunately registration is now closed and we cannot make changes to teams. The good news is this only affects admissions. So, if everyone gets admitted, you are welcome to hack together at the event! <br><br>

	Cheers,<br>
	Hackbot<br>

	Hi, <br><br>

	Thanks for reaching out! Unfortunately registration is now closed. We had 24-hour grace period for stragglers, but now that that period is over, we have begun the admissions process and cannot accept any more applications. <br><br>

	If you are in the Boston area, you are welcome to show up early on the morning of the event to attempt walk-on admission. Walk on tends to be crowded and are not guaranteed, so make sure to arrive early with your government and student IDs! <br><br>

	Otherwise, look out for applications to HackMIT 2018 next year!<br><br>

	Cheers,<br>

	Hi, <br><br>

	Thanks for reaching out! Unfortunately the deadline for confirming your acceptance to HackMIT has passed. We had much more interest in HackMIT than we have space, so unfortunately cannot allow you to confirm your acceptance late. Sorry about that!<br><br>

	If you are in the Boston area, you are welcome to show up early on the morning of the event to attempt walk-on admission. Walk on tends to be crowded and are not guaranteed, so make sure to arrive early with your government and student IDs! <br><br>
